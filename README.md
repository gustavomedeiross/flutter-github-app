# Flutter GitHub App

A simple GitHub app made with Flutter for learning purposes.

## Navigation

On the app, you can store any GitHub user you want and see his starred repositories.
If you want to remove the user from the listing, you can long press his user avatar and drop it on the thrash icon.

## Installation

If you want to try it out, clone the project on your machine and run `flutter run` (you need to have the Flutter SDK installed, as well as a mobile device or emulator to run it).

Feel free to contribute to the project or give me any tips on Flutter!
